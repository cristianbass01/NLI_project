USR: Hi! I'd like a hotel with a 4 star rating and free parking, please.
BOT: Were you looking for a hotel in a particular area?
USR: I'm trying to stay on the east, if possible.
BOT: I have 5 of them in the east. Three of them are cheap and two are moderate priced. Did you have a preference?
USR: The price doesn't matter. What do you recommend?
BOT: I would recommend the allenbell.
USR: Does it have free wifi?
BOT: Yes, it does have free wifi. Would you like me to book this for you?
USR: Not yet. What is their phone number?
BOT: Yes their telephone number is 01223210353.
USR: Great and what is their post code?
BOT: postcode, is cb13js, address is 517a coldham lane, internet and parking is included and price is cheap. Can I help with anything else?
USR: Would you also find me a hotel in the same area?
BOT: In the east, I have 6 different guesthouses and 1 hotel. Do you have a preference?
USR: No, that's OK. The Allenbell is great. What i need is information on boat attraction in the same pay off town.
BOT: Do you want me to book that hotel for you?
USR: I'd just like the phone number and postcode for now. Thank you.
